Optimal irrigation scheduling means applying the right amount of water to the cropland at right time. Proper irrigation scheduling is based on soil water measurements, meteorological data and soil & crop types. Tensiometers measure the soil water tension that can be related to the soil water content.
The present App uses tensiometer data and calculates exact amount of water required for irrigation and Its maximum interval taking into account different irrigation systems and soil & crop types.
The App can be used for Optimal irrigation scheduling which will prevent wastage of water by minimizing runoff and percolation losses and, thus maximises irrigation efficiency. This will result in lower water and energy use and optimal crop yield. 
Using soil water tension data and taking into account soil type, crop type and location of cropland in the country, exact amount of irrigation water required and and its maximum interval is calculated instantaneously after putting in tensiometer gauge data.

Using data related to soil type, crop type, cropland area, location of cropland, season and tensiometer gauge reading,
The App provides decision whether irrigation is to be carried out.
The App provides exact amount of water in volume to be applied in irrigation.
It provides information about Maximum Irrigation Interval also.
It provides a history of irrigation water used for the crop. 
The App is developed for micro-irrigation systems (sprinkler & drip). However, it can easily be extended to other types of irrigation systems like canal system by suitably incorporating the data related to efficiencies etc.


The App can easily be modified for designing a new irrigation system (sprinkler or drip) for the proposed crops in the given cropland. Number of sprinklers with rate of application and pressure for sprinkler irrigation and number of emitters with rate of flow & pressure for drip irrigation can be estimated.
Annual irrigation water requirement for a particular farmland can also be find out by knowing different crop to be grown in different seasons.
